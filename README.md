# Survey-form

### Description: ### 

Created using HTMl5 and CSS3. The design was to make a survey form on the FreeCodeCamp. The point of the project was to take everything we learnt and combine it into one big project. The design of the project was a simple template and I just followed the steps and changed things differently.


### Things I did differently from the original design: ### 

I added my own CSS rather than use the inline css in the web. Since this was a tutorial from FreeCodeCamp I decided that I would change some parts to make my own version. I instead went for cleaner code rather than following the whole excample from FreeCodeCamp.


### Instructions: ###

The user loads the web page and then they fill in a survey. Once they have finished completing the survey, they don't need to do anything else. The webpage will give the user a completion form which tells them they have completed the form and they don't need to do anything else. 

### Constraints: ### 

I didn't add any PHP to get it working. I also had an isse where some of the elements would overlap each other. In order to fix that problem I managed to use padding in CSS to fix that issue. After using that paddding it solved my problem and I no longer had any elements overlapping each other. Another constraint that I managed to overcome was that when the user resized the webpage it would cause the wdith and height to be

Improvements: Like I said before, I didn't manage to get any PHP to work. If I want this survey to store information, then I can use PHP to get some of these functiosn to work.


### Things I will add in the future: ###
I will add PHP and get it working
