Created using HTMl5 and CSS3. The desgin was to make a survey form on the FreeCodeCamp. The point of the project was to take everything we learnt and combine it into one big project.

The design of the project was a simple template and I just followed the steps and changed things differently.

I didn't add any PHP to get it working.

Things I did differently from the orignal design:
I added my own CSS rather than use the inline css in the web

Problems with the project:
I had an issue where some things would overlap each other so I had to change measurements.
I managed to fix an issue that caused the webpage to be different if the user changes the width and height.

Things I will add in the future:
I will add PHP and get it working
